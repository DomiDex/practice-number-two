**Warm-up**

1. **Even Stevens:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop to print all the even numbers.
2. **Odd Todd:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop to print all the odd numbers.
3. **Simple Sum:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop to calculate and return the sum of all the numbers.
4. **Factorial Fun:** Write a function that takes a number as input and uses a for loop to calculate its factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1).
5. **String Reverser:** Write a function that takes a string as input and uses a for loop to return the string reversed.

**Level Up**

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a function that takes a number `n` as input and uses a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.
2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Write a function that takes two numbers as input and uses a for loop to find their GCD.
3. **Remove Duplicates:** Write a function that takes an array as input and uses a for loop to remove all duplicate elements, returning a new array with only unique values.
4. **Character Frequency:** Write a function that takes a string as input and uses a for loop to count the frequency of each character, returning an object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.
5. **Array Chunking:** Write a function that takes an array and a chunk size as input and uses a for loop to split the array into smaller arrays of the given size.

**Get Creative**

1. **Pyramid Power:** Write a function that takes a number as input and uses nested for loops to print a pyramid pattern of stars (e.g., if the input is 5, the output should be a pyramid with 5 rows).
2. **Pascal's Triangle:** Write a function that takes a number as input and uses nested for loops to generate and print Pascal's Triangle up to that number of rows.
3. **Prime Number Checker:** Write a function that takes a number as input and uses a for loop to determine if it's a prime number.
4. **Array Rotation:** Write a function that takes an array and a number `n` as input and uses a for loop to rotate the array to the right by `n` positions.
5. **Pattern Printing:** Write a function that takes a number as input and uses nested for loops to print a diamond pattern of stars.

**Challenge Yourself**

1. **Matrix Multiplication:** Write a function that takes two matrices (2D arrays) as input and uses nested for loops to perform matrix multiplication.
2. **Sorting Algorithms:** Implement a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort or insertion sort) using for loops to sort an array of numbers.
3. **Binary Search:** Write a function that takes a sorted array and a target value as input and uses a for loop to implement binary search to find the index of the target value in the array (or -1 if it's not found).
4. **Longest Common Subsequence:** Write a function that takes two strings as input and uses nested for loops to find the longest common subsequence of the two strings.
5. **Sudoku Solver:** Write a function that takes a Sudoku puzzle (represented as a 2D array with some missing values) as input and uses for loops and backtracking to try to solve the puzzle.

**Important Notes:**

- **Types:** Remember to use TypeScript types for function parameters, return values, and variables to get the benefits of type checking.
- **Testing:** Write test cases for your functions to ensure they work correctly with different inputs.
- **Efficiency:** Think about the efficiency of your solutions, especially for larger inputs. Consider different loop optimization techniques if needed.
- **Comments:** Add clear comments to your code to explain the logic and make it more readable.

These challenges are designed to help you practice using functions and for loops in TypeScript. Start with the warm-up challenges and gradually work your way up to the more difficult ones. Good luck, and have fun coding!
